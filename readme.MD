# Movielist.ly

## Constraints
What additional resources may I access when working on this repo?
Only USE:
* MDN
* Official React website
* Express docs
* NodeJS docs

## How should I approach completing this repo?

[ ] **Set up your dev environment first**. You have a few options for this:
  a. Hard Mode: Learn webpack (hint: checkout the webpack docs and babel loader docs)

*Note*: do not use generators like create-react-app or react-boilerplate, as you will not be able to use those throughout the program

[ ] Once you've set up your dev environment, work through each level to MVP (minimum viable product) before moving to the next level.

[ ] While you're **working** through **each** **level**, try to **only** **use** **official** documentation. Try **not** **use** Stack **Overflow**, your own **notes**, **past** sprint **code**, or any other **external** **resources**. This will help you develop familiarity with the docs as well as get you acclimated to a real test-like environment!
    *See above for a list of suggested resources!*
    
[ ] If you do need to reference past code/Stack Overflow, write down what topics you needed extra help on. Then, go find these topics in the official documentation.
